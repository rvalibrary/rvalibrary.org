morals and warping the intellect of our own race.'  <br><br>'...that, exactly, is what this convention was elected for – to discriminate to the very
extremity...permissible...under the Federal Constitution, with a view to the elimination of every
negro voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength
of the white electorate. As has been said, we have accomplished our purpose strictly within the
limitation of the Federal Constitution by legislating against the characteristics of the black race,
